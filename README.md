This repository contains the contents of a makeshift Password Manager created by Miguel Ocque (mocque@bu.edu). The goal of the Password Manager is to provide users the ability to store, create, retrieve and encrypt passwords as they desire, with the option to do so as many times as they wish until they choose to quit. 

"Under the Hood" this Password Manager utilizes Data Structures such as Linked Lists and Queues to store and retrieve the data that the user chooses to input into the program. 

Finally, by the end of the development process, this program will have the ability to save all passwords written onto a text file at the termination of the program.
